CustomNotes adds the ability to swap out the default notes with custom ones in Beat Saber.

## Notes on score submission
While using a Custom Note and playing with the "Ghost Notes" or "Disappearing Arrows" modifier turned on, high scores will be temporarily disabled.
By switching back to the Default Note or turning off these modifiers, high scores will be re-enabled.
No need to restart the game!
